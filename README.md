# FARM-E
The robot does basic plantation (Ploughing, Sowing, Watering & Enclosing) functions when placed on a field in a regular interval of time and also updates information like temperature & humidity

The robot was programmed using Arduino IDE. Arduino UNO & NodeMCU 1.2 were the boards used and were interfaced using Serial Communication. A funnel & water tank was 3D printed to fit the needs. All the components were placed in a custom made metal chasis and was mobilised using 200 RPM DC Geared Motors.

The robot can either be automated or controlled manually through an app created using MIT App Inventor. The temperature and humidity readings are also displayed on the app.

When compared to an average plantation machine, this robot performs a variety of tasks on one go.
